  ROUGH.JS: Library for creating "hand-drawn" graphics
  Used for:
  - Procedural underlines on links (each one unique!)
  - The sketchy back arrow on post pages
  - Any other hand-drawn decorative elements

  MAIN CONTENT AREA
  The body_class placeholder allows different page types to have different layouts:
  - "centered-list" for index page (content centered vertically)
  - "post-page" for blog posts (standard article layout)
  - "hero" for the about page
  -->
  <main class="post-page">
    <!-- 
POST WRAPPER
Contains all post content with constrained width for readability.
The max-width of 70ch (70 characters) is considered optimal for reading.
-->
<div class="post-wrapper">

  <!-- 
  BACK ARROW
  A link back to the index page. The actual arrow is drawn by JavaScript
  using rough.js - this creates the hand-drawn aesthetic.
  
  How it works:
  1. This <a> element is empty (no visible text/content)
  2. script.js finds elements with class "back-arrow"
  3. It creates a <canvas> element inside
  4. rough.js draws a sketchy arrow on the canvas
  5. CSS positions it to the left of the title
  -->
  <a class="back-arrow" href="/index.html" aria-label="Back to notes"></a>

  <!-- 
  POST HEADER
  Title uses inline styles for specific sizing.
  These could be moved to CSS classes for cleaner separation.
  -->
  <h1 style="font-size: 2.5rem; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">On the Politeness of Machines</h1>

  <!-- 
  SUBTITLE
  Shows series information ("Part 1 of 4") and/or a tagline.
  Uses the --text-faded color for visual hierarchy.
  -->
  <p class="hero-subtitle" style="font-size: 1.1rem; color: var(--text-faded);">

  ARTICLE BODY
  The main content of the post, converted from markdown.
  
  IMPORTANT: The markdown converter handles:
  - Paragraphs → <p> tags
  - Headers → <h2>, <h3> (h1 is reserved for title)
  - Code blocks → <pre><code class="language-xxx">
  - Math → $...$ for inline, $$...$$ for display
  - Footnote refs → <a class="footnote-ref">
  -->
  <article style="max-width: 70ch; line-height: 1.7;">
    <p>The thing about these systems that say &quot;please&quot; and &quot;thank you&quot; back to you is that they are teaching you a kind of etiquette while also making it feel like etiquette is optional, which is a very strange double lesson. You are simultaneously being trained to be nice to something that is not a person and trained to expect that niceness is a feature you can toggle off when the UI irritates you.</p>
<p>The old-school version of politeness was about friction, about having to slow down enough to remember that another person was in the room. The new version is about convenience: the machine does the remembering for you, which is both a gift and a seduction. You start to feel like politeness is a UI style sheet.</p>
<p>If that sounds melodramatic, good. Melodrama is just the body getting loud when the brain tries to be reasonable. The reasonable story is that this is harmless. The louder story is that any culture that outsources its courtesy is going to discover that the robots are better at politeness than we are, which is not a compliment.</p>
