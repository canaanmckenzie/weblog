  ROUGH.JS: Library for creating "hand-drawn" graphics
  Used for:
  - Procedural underlines on links (each one unique!)
  - The sketchy back arrow on post pages
  - Any other hand-drawn decorative elements

  MAIN CONTENT AREA
  The body_class placeholder allows different page types to have different layouts:
  - "centered-list" for index page (content centered vertically)
  - "post-page" for blog posts (standard article layout)
  - "hero" for the about page
  -->
  <main class="post-page">
    <!-- 
POST WRAPPER
Contains all post content with constrained width for readability.
The max-width of 70ch (70 characters) is considered optimal for reading.
-->
<div class="post-wrapper">

  <!-- 
  BACK ARROW
  A link back to the index page. The actual arrow is drawn by JavaScript
  using rough.js - this creates the hand-drawn aesthetic.
  
  How it works:
  1. This <a> element is empty (no visible text/content)
  2. script.js finds elements with class "back-arrow"
  3. It creates a <canvas> element inside
  4. rough.js draws a sketchy arrow on the canvas
  5. CSS positions it to the left of the title

  <!-- 
  POST HEADER
  Title uses inline styles for specific sizing.
  These could be moved to CSS classes for cleaner separation.

  <h1 style="font-size: 2.5rem; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">The World Well Lost</h1>

  <!-- 
  SUBTITLE
  Shows series information ("Part 1 of 4") and/or a tagline.
  Uses the --text-faded color for visual hierarchy.

    <p>&quot;Since Kant, we find it almost impossible not to think of the mind as divided into active and passive faculties, the former using the concepts to &quot;interpret&quot; what &quot;the world&quot; imposes on the latter.&quot; -Richard Rorty <em>The World Well Lost</em></p>
<p>precept &mdash; used here as a quasi mythical layer of perception that guides subsequent judgment and response.</p>
<p>It is difficult not to distinguish between the concepts the mind can&#39;t function without and those which are more &quot;take or leave it&quot;. Considering those former &quot;truths&quot; to be &quot;necessary&quot; seems proper<sup><a id="footnote-ref-1" href="#footnote-1" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup>. However, by categorizing those <em>a priori</em> concepts against their dependent relatives, our experiences and morals, we can easily imagine that those transcendental conditions. Or, more terrestrial, &quot;ground truths&quot; could be different.</p>
<p>Now, it is difficult to pratically imagine what that would be like as an individual already afflicted by those <em>a priori</em> concepts, however in the abstract we can posit that from different fundamental axioms a different world model or worldview may emerge.</p>
<p>Kant argues that to change one&#39;s concepts (here I&#39;m going to start using the term &#39;precepts&#39; because I think it&#39;s more correct) would be to change the &quot;phenomenal world&quot; that one experiences. The possibility of different preceptual schemas highlight the fact that a Kantian unsynthesized intuition cannot influence how it is synthesized. Or more simply, it can only be described in a way relative to a chosen preceptual scheme as a description of everything else. Rorty argues that so far as Kantian intuition is &quot;effable&quot; it is a perceptual judgment, and therefore bound by it&#39;s precepts and not &quot;intuitive,&quot; the &quot;ineffable&quot; nature of it can therefore not be explained or have an explanatory function since to explain it would have to be done from within the set of phenomenological properties that engenders it <sup><a id="footnote-ref-3" href="#footnote-3" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Hegelians raised these concerns with the thing-in-itself. If we are unable to separate the physical thrust of stimulus upon the organ and the concious judgement the preceptually programmed organism forms in response, then in priciple it is beyond thought and experience and thus can&#39;t explain the structure of experience.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Receptivity:</strong> passively receiving sensory manifolds</li>
<li><strong>Spontaneity:</strong> Actively applying concepts/judgements to it</li>
</ul>
<p>Why posit there is an intermediary &quot;precept&quot; if we can&#39;t justify conceptually distinguishing the reaction from the stimulus. Epistemically if the precept was introduced to be grounds or justification for judgment, then we are faced with the dilemma of the precept or intermediary being ineffable/nonconceptual, that it can&#39;t function as a reason, it&#39;s just a constant. If it can be articulated to justify judgement, than it is already in the scope and therefore not independent receptive layer.</p>
<p><em>&quot;Why posit a &quot;receptive&quot; layer between stimulus and judgement if that layer is either a) not sayable/thinkable and therefor cannot explain/justify, or b) sayable/thinkable and therefore already part of judgement.</em></p>
