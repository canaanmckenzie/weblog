  ROUGH.JS: Library for creating "hand-drawn" graphics
  Used for:
  - Procedural underlines on links (each one unique!)
  - The sketchy back arrow on post pages
  - Any other hand-drawn decorative elements

  MAIN CONTENT AREA
  The body_class placeholder allows different page types to have different layouts:
  - "centered-list" for index page (content centered vertically)
  - "post-page" for blog posts (standard article layout)
  - "hero" for the about page
  -->
  <main class="post-page">
    <!-- 
POST WRAPPER
Contains all post content with constrained width for readability.
The max-width of 70ch (70 characters) is considered optimal for reading.
-->
<div class="post-wrapper">

  <!-- 
  BACK ARROW
  A link back to the index page. The actual arrow is drawn by JavaScript
  using rough.js - this creates the hand-drawn aesthetic.
  
  How it works:
  1. This <a> element is empty (no visible text/content)
  2. script.js finds elements with class "back-arrow"
  3. It creates a <canvas> element inside
  4. rough.js draws a sketchy arrow on the canvas
  5. CSS positions it to the left of the title
  -->
  <a class="back-arrow" href="/index.html" aria-label="Back to notes"></a>

  <!-- 
  POST HEADER
  Title uses inline styles for specific sizing.
  These could be moved to CSS classes for cleaner separation.
  -->
  <h1 style="font-size: 2.5rem; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Sincerity, Automation, and the Terror of Ease</h1>

  <!-- 
  SUBTITLE
  Shows series information ("Part 1 of 4") and/or a tagline.
  Uses the --text-faded color for visual hierarchy.
  -->
  <p class="hero-subtitle" style="font-size: 1.1rem; color: var(--text-faded);">

  ARTICLE BODY
  The main content of the post, converted from markdown.
  
  IMPORTANT: The markdown converter handles:
  - Paragraphs → <p> tags
  - Headers → <h2>, <h3> (h1 is reserved for title)
  - Code blocks → <pre><code class="language-xxx">
  - Math → $...$ for inline, $$...$$ for display
  - Footnote refs → <a class="footnote-ref">
  -->
  <article style="max-width: 70ch; line-height: 1.7;">
    <p>The real seduction of automation is not speed but relief. You hand off a task and with it you hand off the small private anxiety that you might not do it well. The machine writes the email, the paragraph, the apology, and you feel a quick hit of gratitude. The problem is that gratitude, for a machine, is a dead end.</p>
<p>Sincerity is a form of effort. It is a practice of making the reader do as little interpretive work as possible, which is to say you do the work yourself. The more we automate the work, the more sincerity starts to look like a style rather than a discipline, and that is the beginning of a very deep kind of laziness.</p>
<p>If the future is one in which machines can generate our tone for us, then the most radical thing you can do might be to speak in a way that is inefficient. To pause, to explain, to fail in public, to admit you are not sure. Those are human costs, and I think the costs are the point.</p>
