  ROUGH.JS: Library for creating "hand-drawn" graphics
  Used for:
  - Procedural underlines on links (each one unique!)
  - The sketchy back arrow on post pages
  - Any other hand-drawn decorative elements

  MAIN CONTENT AREA
  The body_class placeholder allows different page types to have different layouts:
  - "centered-list" for index page (content centered vertically)
  - "post-page" for blog posts (standard article layout)
  - "hero" for the about page
  -->
  <main class="post-page">
    <!-- 
POST WRAPPER
Contains all post content with constrained width for readability.
The max-width of 70ch (70 characters) is considered optimal for reading.
-->
<div class="post-wrapper">

  <!-- 
  BACK ARROW
  A link back to the index page. The actual arrow is drawn by JavaScript
  using rough.js - this creates the hand-drawn aesthetic.
  
  How it works:
  1. This <a> element is empty (no visible text/content)
  2. script.js finds elements with class "back-arrow"
  3. It creates a <canvas> element inside
  4. rough.js draws a sketchy arrow on the canvas
  5. CSS positions it to the left of the title

  <!-- 
  POST HEADER
  Title uses inline styles for specific sizing.
  These could be moved to CSS classes for cleaner separation.

  <!-- 
  SUBTITLE
  Shows series information ("Part 1 of 4") and/or a tagline.
  Uses the --text-faded color for visual hierarchy.

    <p>A lot of writing theory gets described like its a set of sleek levers, a kind of white-board physics for prose, but what I see, at 2 a.m., is more like a factory shift. Attention is a working-class resource: it clocks in late, it takes smoke breaks, it gets injured on the job. The theory that is most humane is the theory that admits this and builds the sentence as a workplace with safety rails.</p>
<p>When a paragraph gives you a place to stand, to look, to breathe, it is not being precious; it is paying wages. A sentence that runs too long is not a sin, but it does require that the reader has the endurance to keep lifting. The tools of theory are less like laws and more like union contracts: the agreements by which writer and reader do not exploit one another.</p>
<p>So the cliché of clarity, which sounds like some antiseptic policy memo, is actually a kindness. It is a refusal to make the reader do extra labor just to locate the verb. You can still be weird, still be angular, still be honest about how the mind jerks around; you just don&#39;t leave the reader alone in the dark with a flashlight that has no batteries.</p>
<p>There is a way to write that feels like supervision, like the author staring over your shoulder. The better theory is a foreman who knows your name and lets you pick the music. It trusts you to make sense, and it leaves you a map.</p>
<p>Footnote: the map is not the territory. But if you keep telling yourself that, you end up with a territory that only you can navigate, which is how writing starts to smell like vanity. And if the theory is about anything at all, its about keeping the smell down.<sup><a id="footnote-ref-1" href="#footnote-1" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup></p>
