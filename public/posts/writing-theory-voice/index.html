  ROUGH.JS: Library for creating "hand-drawn" graphics
  Used for:
  - Procedural underlines on links (each one unique!)
  - The sketchy back arrow on post pages
  - Any other hand-drawn decorative elements

  MAIN CONTENT AREA
  The body_class placeholder allows different page types to have different layouts:
  - "centered-list" for index page (content centered vertically)
  - "post-page" for blog posts (standard article layout)
  - "hero" for the about page
  -->
  <main class="post-page">
    <!-- 
POST WRAPPER
Contains all post content with constrained width for readability.
The max-width of 70ch (70 characters) is considered optimal for reading.
-->
<div class="post-wrapper">

  <!-- 
  BACK ARROW
  A link back to the index page. The actual arrow is drawn by JavaScript
  using rough.js - this creates the hand-drawn aesthetic.
  
  How it works:
  1. This <a> element is empty (no visible text/content)
  2. script.js finds elements with class "back-arrow"
  3. It creates a <canvas> element inside
  4. rough.js draws a sketchy arrow on the canvas
  5. CSS positions it to the left of the title
  -->
  <a class="back-arrow" href="/index.html" aria-label="Back to notes"></a>

  <!-- 
  POST HEADER
  Title uses inline styles for specific sizing.
  These could be moved to CSS classes for cleaner separation.
  -->
  <h1 style="font-size: 2.5rem; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Footnotes Toward a Theory of Voice</h1>

  <!-- 
  SUBTITLE
  Shows series information ("Part 1 of 4") and/or a tagline.
  Uses the --text-faded color for visual hierarchy.

  ARTICLE BODY
  The main content of the post, converted from markdown.
  
  IMPORTANT: The markdown converter handles:
  - Paragraphs → <p> tags
  - Headers → <h2>, <h3> (h1 is reserved for title)
  - Code blocks → <pre><code class="language-xxx">
  - Math → $...$ for inline, $$...$$ for display
  - Footnote refs → <a class="footnote-ref">

  <article style="max-width: 70ch; line-height: 1.7;">
    <p>The first lie writing theory tells is that voice is something you discover, like a lost dog. The truth is messier: you keep trying on voices the way you keep trying on shoes, and then you look down and realize you&#39;ve walked three miles in something that pinches. Voice is not a stable identity; it is the residue of attention applied consistently over time.</p>
<p>Theory that treats voice as a vibe makes the student nervous, like there is a single correct accent and they do not come from the right neighborhood. The better theory is procedural: it says if you keep telling the truth about what you notice, the cadence will emerge like a trail of footprints that also happens to be you.</p>
<p>A good voice is not always loud. It is specific, and the specificity is a kind of courage: you are willing to say that the coffee was burnt, not just hot, and that the burnt-ness matters because it rhymes with the day you are trying to describe. The voice is the rhyming engine, not the megaphone.</p>
<p>Footnote: students often ask if footnotes are a crutch. I tell them a crutch is better than a fall, and sometimes the footnote is the only honest place to put the stuff you do not want to make the reader carry in the main corridor of the sentence.<sup><a id="footnote-ref-1" href="#footnote-1" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup></p>
<section class="footnotes" data-footnotes>
<h2 id="footnote-label" class="sr-only">Footnotes</h2>
<ol>
<li id="footnote-1">
<p>Another way to say this is that the footnote is where the voice confesses its own insecurity, which is a high-risk move and therefore usually very human. <a href="#footnote-ref-1" data-footnote-backref aria-label="Back to reference 1">↩</a></p>

    <!-- 
    FOOTNOTES SECTION
    Only included if the post has footnotes.
    Uses DFW-style footnotes (verbose, essayistic asides).
    
    The markdown format for footnotes:
    [^1]: This is a footnote that appears at the bottom.
    
    In the text: Here is a claim[^1] that needs elaboration.
