  ROUGH.JS: Library for creating "hand-drawn" graphics
  Used for:
  - Procedural underlines on links (each one unique!)
  - The sketchy back arrow on post pages
  - Any other hand-drawn decorative elements

  MAIN CONTENT AREA
  The body_class placeholder allows different page types to have different layouts:
  - "centered-list" for index page (content centered vertically)
  - "post-page" for blog posts (standard article layout)
  - "hero" for the about page
  -->
  <main class="post-page">
    <!-- 
POST WRAPPER
Contains all post content with constrained width for readability.
The max-width of 70ch (70 characters) is considered optimal for reading.
-->
<div class="post-wrapper">

  <!-- 
  BACK ARROW
  A link back to the index page. The actual arrow is drawn by JavaScript
  using rough.js - this creates the hand-drawn aesthetic.
  
  How it works:
  1. This <a> element is empty (no visible text/content)
  2. script.js finds elements with class "back-arrow"
  3. It creates a <canvas> element inside
  4. rough.js draws a sketchy arrow on the canvas
  5. CSS positions it to the left of the title
  -->
  <a class="back-arrow" href="/index.html" aria-label="Back to notes"></a>

  <!-- 
  POST HEADER
  Title uses inline styles for specific sizing.
  These could be moved to CSS classes for cleaner separation.
  -->
  <h1 style="font-size: 2.5rem; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Artificial Intelligence and the Economy of Attention</h1>

  <!-- 
  SUBTITLE
  Shows series information ("Part 1 of 4") and/or a tagline.
  Uses the --text-faded color for visual hierarchy.
  -->
  <p class="hero-subtitle" style="font-size: 1.1rem; color: var(--text-faded);">

  ARTICLE BODY
  The main content of the post, converted from markdown.
  
  IMPORTANT: The markdown converter handles:
  - Paragraphs → <p> tags
  - Headers → <h2>, <h3> (h1 is reserved for title)
  - Code blocks → <pre><code class="language-xxx">
  - Math → $...$ for inline, $$...$$ for display
  - Footnote refs → <a class="footnote-ref">

  <article style="max-width: 70ch; line-height: 1.7;">
    <p>A reader&#39;s attention has always been a kind of rent, but the new machinery makes it feel like a subscription with an auto-renewal that you forgot to cancel. You read a thing, you get served another thing, and somewhere behind the curtain a prediction engine is noting how long you blinked between clauses.</p>
<p>The AI parts are a mirror and a megaphone. The mirror shows us that we have been trained to want an explanation for everything, preferably in a tone that does not challenge us. The megaphone amplifies the habit, which is to say it trains us to expect a world where the answer is always waiting and always politely spoken.</p>
<p>There is a quiet grief in realizing that the strongest thing you can do for your own attention is to stop, to refuse to keep scrolling, to sit in a paragraph long enough for it to turn into a room you can occupy. This is not a moral posture. It is a survival tactic.</p>

    FOOTNOTES SECTION
    Only included if the post has footnotes.
    Uses DFW-style footnotes (verbose, essayistic asides).
    
    The markdown format for footnotes:
    [^1]: This is a footnote that appears at the bottom.
    
    In the text: Here is a claim[^1] that needs elaboration.
