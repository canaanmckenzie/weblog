        <p>Antediluvian field notes. This is a loci for whatever musings I want on electric page. I&#39;ll expand on themes as they emerge; the nature of this is simply to write.</p>
<p><em>&quot;This is the upshoot now remember of a tradition that is at least 2500 years old, and now that tradition is produced in tiny little articles – four, five page articles – in journals that are read by a number of people that’s a small enough number that if they were all in a boat and it sank, they would have no readership. And it could be a small boat, it wouldn’t need to be Lusitania, it could be a raft, perhaps.&quot;</em></p>
