A reader's attention has always been a kind of rent, but the new machinery makes it feel like a subscription with an auto-renewal that you forgot to cancel. You read a thing, you get served another thing, and somewhere behind the curtain a prediction engine is noting how long you blinked between clauses.

The AI parts are a mirror and a megaphone. The mirror shows us that we have been trained to want an explanation for everything, preferably in a tone that does not challenge us. The megaphone amplifies the habit, which is to say it trains us to expect a world where the answer is always waiting and always politely spoken.

There is a quiet grief in realizing that the strongest thing you can do for your own attention is to stop, to refuse to keep scrolling, to sit in a paragraph long enough for it to turn into a room you can occupy. This is not a moral posture. It is a survival tactic.
