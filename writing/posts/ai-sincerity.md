The real seduction of automation is not speed but relief. You hand off a task and with it you hand off the small private anxiety that you might not do it well. The machine writes the email, the paragraph, the apology, and you feel a quick hit of gratitude. The problem is that gratitude, for a machine, is a dead end.

Sincerity is a form of effort. It is a practice of making the reader do as little interpretive work as possible, which is to say you do the work yourself. The more we automate the work, the more sincerity starts to look like a style rather than a discipline, and that is the beginning of a very deep kind of laziness.

If the future is one in which machines can generate our tone for us, then the most radical thing you can do might be to speak in a way that is inefficient. To pause, to explain, to fail in public, to admit you are not sure. Those are human costs, and I think the costs are the point.
