"Since Kant, we find it almost impossible not to think of the mind as divided into active and passive faculties, the former using the concepts to "interpret" what "the world" imposes on the latter." -Richard Rorty *The World Well Lost*

It is difficult not to distinguish between the concepts the mind can't function without and those which are more "take or leave it". Considering those former "truths" to be "necessary" seems proper[^1]. However, by categorizing those *a priori* concepts against their dependent relatives, our experiences and morals, we can easily imagine that those transcendental conditions. Or, more terrestrial, "ground truths" could be different.

Now, it is difficult to pratically imagine what that would be, however in the abstract we can posit that from different fundamental axioms a different world model or worldview may emerge.

[^1]: So much so that the phrasing "the mind can't function without" buries that inevitability within the framing.
