The thing about these systems that say "please" and "thank you" back to you is that they are teaching you a kind of etiquette while also making it feel like etiquette is optional, which is a very strange double lesson. You are simultaneously being trained to be nice to something that is not a person and trained to expect that niceness is a feature you can toggle off when the UI irritates you.

The old-school version of politeness was about friction, about having to slow down enough to remember that another person was in the room. The new version is about convenience: the machine does the remembering for you, which is both a gift and a seduction. You start to feel like politeness is a UI style sheet.

If that sounds melodramatic, good. Melodrama is just the body getting loud when the brain tries to be reasonable. The reasonable story is that this is harmless. The louder story is that any culture that outsources its courtesy is going to discover that the robots are better at politeness than we are, which is not a compliment.
