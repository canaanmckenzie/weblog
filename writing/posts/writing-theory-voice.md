The first lie writing theory tells is that voice is something you discover, like a lost dog. The truth is messier: you keep trying on voices the way you keep trying on shoes, and then you look down and realize you've walked three miles in something that pinches. Voice is not a stable identity; it is the residue of attention applied consistently over time.

Theory that treats voice as a vibe makes the student nervous, like there is a single correct accent and they do not come from the right neighborhood. The better theory is procedural: it says if you keep telling the truth about what you notice, the cadence will emerge like a trail of footprints that also happens to be you.

A good voice is not always loud. It is specific, and the specificity is a kind of courage: you are willing to say that the coffee was burnt, not just hot, and that the burnt-ness matters because it rhymes with the day you are trying to describe. The voice is the rhyming engine, not the megaphone.

Footnote: students often ask if footnotes are a crutch. I tell them a crutch is better than a fall, and sometimes the footnote is the only honest place to put the stuff you do not want to make the reader carry in the main corridor of the sentence.[^1]

[^1]: Another way to say this is that the footnote is where the voice confesses its own insecurity, which is a high-risk move and therefore usually very human.
