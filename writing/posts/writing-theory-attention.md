A lot of writing theory gets described like its a set of sleek levers, a kind of white-board physics for prose, but what I see, at 2 a.m., is more like a factory shift. Attention is a working-class resource: it clocks in late, it takes smoke breaks, it gets injured on the job. The theory that is most humane is the theory that admits this and builds the sentence as a workplace with safety rails.

When a paragraph gives you a place to stand, to look, to breathe, it is not being precious; it is paying wages. A sentence that runs too long is not a sin, but it does require that the reader has the endurance to keep lifting. The tools of theory are less like laws and more like union contracts: the agreements by which writer and reader do not exploit one another.

So the cliché of clarity, which sounds like some antiseptic policy memo, is actually a kindness. It is a refusal to make the reader do extra labor just to locate the verb. You can still be weird, still be angular, still be honest about how the mind jerks around; you just don't leave the reader alone in the dark with a flashlight that has no batteries.

There is a way to write that feels like supervision, like the author staring over your shoulder. The better theory is a foreman who knows your name and lets you pick the music. It trusts you to make sense, and it leaves you a map.

Footnote: the map is not the territory. But if you keep telling yourself that, you end up with a territory that only you can navigate, which is how writing starts to smell like vanity. And if the theory is about anything at all, its about keeping the smell down.[^1]

[^1]: I mean "smell" as in ego, not as in your actual room, which, if you are like me, is full of cold coffee and the faint sadness of old drafts.
